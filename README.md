There are several jquery marquees but most of them can't work correctly in AngularJS

This marquee is rewrite entirely in Angular environment. It's using CSS3 animation.

Here are useful attributes:

example:

<div simple-marquee scroll='scroll' duration='duration'>
	<div id="content">You can place any content at here</div>
</div>
